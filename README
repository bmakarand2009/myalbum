MyAlbum is a copy of Jeff Brown demo on a NFJS class, which demos grails with ajax capabilities.
It has been converted to a plugin.
Goal is to see if we can install it as a plugin in other projecs

Note: _events.groovy is a new feature to exclude resources from plugin


This plugin, does not work, as it has a template in it, 

I have tried various approaches to get this plugin work but it does not, here are the approaches

   <g:render template="album/tracks" model="[theTracksToRender:album.tracks]" plugin="myalbum"/> 

   <g:render template="album/tracks" model="[theTracksToRender:album.tracks]" contextPath="${pluginContextPath}"/>
